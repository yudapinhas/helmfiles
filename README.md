## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Start

Ensure you have `helmfile`, `kubectl`, and a running local Kubernetes cluster (like `minikube`).

1. Clone the repository
2. Deploy everything using:

```bash
make core-deploy
```

This will result with
- ArgoCD available at https://localhost:8443
- Jenkins available at http://localhost:8080 / ngrok public url in jenkins container logs.
- Argo-apps deployed and managed by argoCD - verify with ```kubectl get applications -n argocd``` 

## ‚ñ∂ For ArgoWF and data etl pipelines run
```bash
make argoworkflows-deploy
```
